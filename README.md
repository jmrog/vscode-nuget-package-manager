# vscode-nuget-package-manager

An extension for Visual Studio Code that lets you easily add or remove 
.NET Core 1.1+ package references to/from your project's `.csproj` or `.fsproj`
files using Code's Command Palette.

## Features

- Search the NuGet package repository for packages using either (partial
or full) package name or another search term.
- Add PackageReference dependencies to your .NET Core 1.1+ `.csproj` or
`.fsproj` files from Visual Studio Code's Command Palette.
- Remove installed packages from your project's `.csproj` or `.fsproj` files via
Visual Studio Code's Command Palette.
- Handles workspaces with multiple `.csproj` or `.fsproj` files as well as
workspaces with single `.csproj`/`.fsproj` files.

## Known Issues

- The XML-to-JavaScript parser that this extension uses currently strips out
comments from the project file. Unfortunately, there is no way around this
at the moment, but the eventual plan is to replace this dependency.
- The extension does not add DotNetCliToolsReference entries for tools.
